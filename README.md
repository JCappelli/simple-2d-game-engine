# Simple 2D Game Engine
(Work in Progress)

Simple 2D engine for learning and practicing modern C++ features/standards, as well as developing a deeper understanding of underlying game engine architecture in general. 

## Build
Open project in a terminal and run the following command (example is for Visual Studio, but any [Premake supported](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake) project files can be generated)

    ./premake vs2022

Built with C++17 standard, and dependant libraries require project to be built with at least this standard.

### Windows
- 64 bit msvc compiled binaries are all that are supported curently 

### OSX
- Mac builds are not yet supported, library binaries only set up for 64 bit Windows machines
